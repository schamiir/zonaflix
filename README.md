## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

I learned about Firebase which is Google's back-end platform that helps developer to build, improve, and grow their app. I learned how to implement their user authentication and hosting.
I was also introduced to Redux which is a global store that stores the state of variables within the app.

Challenges that I was faced with was some outdated syntax, for example v6 of react-router-dom no longer uses 'Switch' and is now called 'Route'. Another React hook 'useHistory' is also now called 'useNavigate'. So there were a lot of new syntax that I found thanks to Google.
